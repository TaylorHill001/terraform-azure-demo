# Terraform on Azure 101
Understand the core concepts of Terraform applied to Azure Cloud using simple examples.

## Disclaimer
Existing demos are written toward Terraform <= 0.11.x (0.12 migration is planned once released), but provides links to 0.12 documentation equivalents.

## Usage
Follow each subfolders in order to discover Terraform concepts in a somewhat progressive order.

Each demo provides documentation links in the readme.
They should be read beforehand to get a clear understanding of the topics covered.

## Going further
Obviously not everything is detailled here, diving into the official documentation is highly recommended to discover other topics (provisioning, local values, overrides, etc).
